The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can sometimes produce unexpected results or errors due to incorrect syntax or unit mixing. For example, using different units within the calculation (e.g., `calc(100px + 50%)`) can lead to unexpected behavior, and omitting necessary spaces between operators and operands can also result in errors.  Another potential issue is incorrect nesting of calculations, which could lead to parsing errors.
